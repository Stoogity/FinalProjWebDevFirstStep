        Power is not the same as strength. It's really helpful to think of strength as absolute output, while power is better understood as strength over time. Having more strength allows you to use smaller holds and gives you better control over your body in space, while power gives you the ability to move dynamically between holds or to rapidly apply your finger strength as you latch onto a small hold. 

        <br></br>

        How do we train up power for climbing? A classic exercise is to practice "campusing", which is moving between holds without using your feet. This training technique was pioneered by Wolfgang Gullich as part of his preparation for Action Direct, but generally there are better options for developing power. I try to follow the concept of specificity in my training, meaning that I think it is more important to train on similar terrain to my goal routes and practice the kinds of movements I might expect to see on them. Needing to campus a movement is very rare, and so I don't spend much time practicing it. Instead, I prefer to practice limit bouldering.

        <h3>Limit Bouldering</h3>
        What is a limit boulder? Here are some good guidelines:
        <ul>
            <li>A crux that is located within the first few movements so that It can be attempted with 100% effort.</li>
            <li>The crux should be similar to something you might expect to find on a route you are projecting.</li>
            <li>It's generally a good idea to punish poor footwork with these problems - use small footholds and require good use of body tension in order to succeed.</li>
            <li>The crux should be hard enough that it takes a couple of sessions to complete, but not so hard that it will not be possible to complete in this training cycle.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br></br>
        Prior to limit bouldering, it is important to warm up. I tend to do a pyramid-style warmup. Aim to do 15-20 boulders in ascending difficulty, ending at your on-sight level. If you on-sight V5 for example, then do 5x V0/V1, 4x V2, 3x V3, 2x V4, and 1 V5. Take a 5-10 minute break and then you can start trying hard on your limit boulders. Take a few minutes between attempts. Power training is about the quality of your attempts, not the quantity. Once you feel like you can't give 100% effort, end the session. See examples of limit boulders that I set for myself below. In the first video I've already had plenty of time to work the boulder. The original limit move was the 3rd move.
