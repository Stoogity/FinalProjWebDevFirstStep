        The first two weeks I spend on just doing volume training. This would probably look different if your focus was on primarily bouldering. If you're more of a route climber, then getting in the volume is really important. What exactly is volume training? It's putting in the time climbing relatively easy routes, boulder problems, or just traversing. The idea is to get your body ready for the harder training that is coming over the next two months. The purpose of this training is also to help build your aerobic endurance, which as a route climber should be powering most of your movement in tandem with the ATP-CP system.
            <br></br>
            <ul>A few examples:
                <li>Anywhere between 50-100 boulder problems, ensuring that you stay at least two grades below your onsight level. I realize that that range is huge! It depends on your fitness level. I'm usually spent by around 70 boulders.</li>
                <li>60 minutes of traversing easy terrain, split up into smaller chunks of climbing. For example, 15 minutes x4, 10 minutes x6, or 30 minutes x2, with each chunk being separated by a break.</li>
                <li>If you're doing your volume outdoors, then just powering through 8-10 routes is a really great way to train up volume. This has always been hard for me since I don't live close to any great climbing, but this is a fantastic option.</li>
            </ul>
            <br></br>

        Since volume is generally a really low-intensity type of training, this is the best time to do movement drills. For example, practicing precise foot placement, focusing on moving efficiently (not strong-arming movements), practicing efficient rests, etc. Pick a couple of things to be really mindful of during your volume training and work on them throughout the exercise. A really interesting podcast never hurt either! See an example of a training drill below.
