            Strength training is the bread and butter for long-term development in my opinion. As climbers, we don't necessarily want to be putting on weight. Keep this in mind as you progress with your training. I'm going to focus on finger strength in this section, but will include some other important components below.

            <br></br>

            While you can build finger strength through bouldering, I'm going to focus on hangboarding here because it's more deliberate and progress can be measured. Most hangboard protocols can be divided into two types: repeaters and maximum (max) hangs. They are both useful and should both be practiced, but they are not the same.

            <h3>Repeaters</h3>

            Repeaters are what I have done for the majority of my hangboarding. I follow the 7:3 protocol, although the 10:5 is how I started and is probably better in more humid conditions. The first number indicates the duration of the hang in seconds, and the second number indicates the rest duration in seconds. You repeat this cycle 6 times per set, hence the name "repeaters". Each set is separated by a 3 minute rest. I typically select three grip types - and edge, a pocket, and a pinch. I do a half-crimp grip on the edge and open hand on the pocket. It is very critical to practice both of these grip types! See the photos to the right to understand the difference. 

            <br></br>

            Repeaters are a strength-endurance protocol, meaning that they will build strength while also building power endurance. These are not intended to be done at 100% intensity. If you are failing each repetition before the timer is up, then the intensity is too high. Either hang from an easier hold or reduce the weight with a pulley system.

            A repeater workout would look like the following:
            <br></br>
            <ul>
                <li>Open hand 7:3 x6</li>
                <li>3 minute rest</li>
                <li>Open hand 7:3 x6</li>
                <li>3 minute rest</li>
                <li>Half crimp 7:3 x6</li>
                <li>3 minute rest</li>
                <li>Half crimp 7:3 x6</li>
                <li>3 minute rest</li>
                <li>Pinch grip 7:3 x6</li>
                <li>3 minute rest</li>
                <li>Pinch grip 7:3 x6</li>
                <li>Workout complete</li>
            </ul>

            <br></br>

            I usually do the first two grips 3 times in my own workout, but you can make whatever adjustments make sense to you in your own training.

            <br></br>

            <h3>Max Hangs</h3>
            

            Max hangs are different - the intention is to give each hang 100% effort. Hang times range from 4-10 seconds, but you only do a single hang per set. A hang time anywhere between the 4-10 second range is acceptable. These are not intended to build endurance - they improve rate of force development, finger power, and raw finger strength. Each hang is separated by a 3 minute rest. I typically select 2-3 grips and repeat each grip 4 times. See a sample grip cycle below:

            <br></br>

            <ul>
                <li>Half crimp 5s</li>
                <li>3 minute rest</li>
                <li>Half crimp 5s</li>
                <li>3 minute rest</li>
                <li>Half crimp 5s</li>
                <li>3 minute rest</li>
                <li>Half crimp 5s</li>
                <li>3 minute rest</li>
                <li>Next grip 5s</li>
                <li>Etc.</li>
            </ul>

            The video below is actually just a test and was my first time being able to hold the pinch grip at body weight. I was ecstatic! It just also happens to look like a max hang. Repeaters are the same idea, with the exception that you repeat each hang 6 times.
