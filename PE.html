            Power Endurance refers to the ability to execute a series of near maximal movements in sequence without rest and without your muscles failing. This really comes into play during crux sequences. The nice thing about power endurance training is that it trains up extremely quickly - you will reach the maximum benefit within 2-3 weeks. The bad news is that without constant maintenance, it tends to fall off really quickly. This should be the last part of your training cycle.

            <br></br>
            I prefer to train power endurance with linked boulder circuits as opposed to 4x4's. A linked boulder circuit is where you link several boulder problems together and climb them without coming off of the wall. For example, you might climb a V5, then downclimb the V3 next to it, then climb the V4 next to that, and downclimb a V2.

            As with everything else, tailor your power endurance training to your goals. If your project has a very short crux sequence consisting of less than twenty moves, then your circuit should reflect that. If your crux sequence is long but not quite as powerful, then your circuit should reflect that. I generally try to have my circuits consist of roughly 30 hand moves, but your circuit may be shorter or longer.

            <br></br>

            Time how long your circuit takes you, and initially your rest period should be twice as long. Aim to do your circuit 6-8 times per training session. With each session, shorten your rest period. By the end of the second week, you should be resting only as long as it takes you to complete the circuit. You should try to train power endurance 2-3x per week. See a sample circuit below:
